// https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/09/amazon-athena-adds-support-inserting-data-into-table-results-of-select-query/
//
// With this release,
// you can insert new rows into a destination table based on a SELECT query
// statement that runs on a source table,
// or based on a set of values that are provided as part of the query
// statement. Supported data formats include Avro, JSON, ORC, Parquet,
// and Text files.
//
// INSERT INTO statements can also help you simplify your ETL process.
// For example, you can use INSERT INTO to select data from a source table
// that is in JSON format and write to a destination table in Parquet format
// in a single query. INSERT INTO statements are charged based on bytes
// scanned in the Select phase,
// similar to how Athena charges for Select queries.
